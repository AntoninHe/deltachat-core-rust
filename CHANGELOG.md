## 1.0.0-beta1 

- first beta of the Delta Chat Rust core library. many fixes of crashes
  and other issues compared to 1.0.0-alpha.5.

- Most code is now "rustified" and does not do manual memory allocation anymore. 

- The `DC_EVENT_GET_STRING` event is not used anymore, removing the last
  event where the core requested a return value from the event callback. 

  Please now use `dc_set_stock_translation()` API for core messages
  to be properly localized. 

- Deltachat FFI docs are automatically generated and available here: 
  https://c.delta.chat 

- New events ImapMessageMoved and ImapMessageDeleted
